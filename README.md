## First hobby project - web scraping
This was my first project after finishing the course Junior Data Scientist at JDS Academy. The main task of this project was to learn web scraping, therefore there is no real finding presented here.<br>
<br>
Scraping was done by using the Beautiful Soup library and the code was written in Python using Jupyter Notebook. The presented data was scraped from the Goodreads website around June-July 2023.
